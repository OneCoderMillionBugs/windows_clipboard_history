## General information
At the time of writing this text, the default Windows clipboard history 
is capable of storing only copied texts, which, in my opinion, is not very 
convenient, because other operating systems have long had the ability to 
store data in other formats, I decided to make this small application for Windows.

## Features
The application is capable of storing up to 54 copied elements.
List of currently supported formats:
- Text
- Bitmaps (e.g screenshots)
- Files

## Usage
To save data in the history, there is no need for any extra actions, 
the application independently monitors changes occurring in the clipboard. \
In order to return an element from the history to the clipboard, 
just right-click on it in the application (the element then highlighted with a blue frame).
